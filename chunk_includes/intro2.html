<b>Instructions</b>
</p>

<p>
In the experiment, you are going to be reading each sentence <b>one word at a time</b>. When a sentence first appears, it will look like a series of dashes, like this:
</p>
<p>
— —
</p>
<p>
To read the sentence, you will press the <b>spacebar</b>. This will cause the current word to disappear, and will reveal the next word in the sentence. So when you press the spacebar for the first time, the display changes to look something like this:
</p>
<p>
<u>The</u> —
</p>
And when you press it again, that first word disappears to reveal the next part of the sentence.
</p>
<p>
 — <u>students</u>.
</p>
Continue hitting the spacebar all the way through to the end of the sentence, revealing words so that you are reading at normal pace for you. Please do not take breaks when you are in the middle of a sentence. Try to avoid going too slow, but don't go so fast that you can't answer the comprehension question at the end! <b>Note: Please read each sentence silently to yourself. Do not read out loud!</b>
