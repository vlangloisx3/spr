<b>Instructions</b>
</p>


<p>
After you have finished reading, you will see a question about the sentence <b>you just read</b>. Every question has two possible answers. You can indicate your response by pressing "<b>1</b>" if you think the <u>top choice</u> is the correct answer, and "<b>2</b>" if you think the <u>bottom choice</u> is the correct answer. If you answer a comprehension incorrectly, there will be feedback and a <b>delay</b> of 5 seconds before the next sentence. To avoid this, please pay attention when reading the sentences.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the experiment, you should always keep your hands positioned so that your thumbs are on the spacebar, and your fingers are on the "1" and "2" keys. Remember, please try to press the spacebar fast enough to allow for relatively natural reading of the sentence.
</p>
